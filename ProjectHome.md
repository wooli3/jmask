JMask is a clone of the windows application GMask. JMask is written in Java relying on zero third-party libraries or plugins, making it highly portable for more operating systems than Windows (as GMask is limited to currently).

The original masking procedural code has been ported to Java from a gimp plugin which was released under the GPLv2 license.

Supported operations are:
CP Mask, FL Mask, Q0 Mask, Horizontal Flip, Vertical Flip, Horizontal Glass, Vertical Glass, Meko- Mask, Meko+ Mask, Negative, RGB Rotate, Xor, and Win mask.

Supported functionality:
Opening images of various types, saving images of various types, and applying the aforementioned masking operations.

Future Functionality:
Implementing an 'undo' stack for operations, implementation for image zoom, implementation for improved sub-selection creation and editing, and more probably.
